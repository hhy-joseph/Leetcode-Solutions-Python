# LeetCode Solutions Repository

## Description

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in Python. Each solution is accompanied by a detailed `README.md` file that explains the approach, complexity, and usage of the solution.

## Purpose

I am a data scientist with a strong interest in code optimization. This repository serves as part of my resume to showcase my problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and ability to optimize solutions. Each solution demonstrates my approach to tackling different coding challenges, focusing on efficiency and clarity.

## Structure

Each problem has its own folder containing the Python solution and a corresponding `README.md` file. The `README.md` file includes:
- A description of the problem
- The function signature (Optional)
- An explanation of the solution
- Example usage
