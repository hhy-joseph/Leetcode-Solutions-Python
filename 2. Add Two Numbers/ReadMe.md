Explanation:
ListNode Class: Define the ListNode class to create the nodes for the linked list. Each node has a value val and a pointer next to the next node.

Dummy Head: Initialize result and temp_node to a dummy head node. This simplifies the code since we don't need to check if the result list is empty when adding new nodes.

Loop Condition: Continue looping while there are nodes left in l1 or l2, or if there is a carry to be added.

Value Extraction: Extract the current values from l1 and l2. If a list is exhausted, use 0 as the value.

Sum Calculation: Calculate the sum of the values and the carry.

Carry and Reminder: Compute the carry for the next iteration and the remainder (digit to store in the current node).

New Node Creation: Create a new node with the remainder value and link it to the result list.

Move Pointers: Move the temp_node pointer to the new node. Advance l1 and l2 pointers if they are not already exhausted.

Return Result: Return result.next as the head of the result list, skipping the dummy head node.
